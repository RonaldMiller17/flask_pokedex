Using Flask, Python3, SQLAlchemy ORM and Alembic we would like you to create a simple table utilizing an API, The application should fulfill the basic requirements below. The source code must be placed in a public repo on GIthub.
● Utilizing the Pokedex API at ​https://pokeapi.co/​ Create a table that displays the Kanto pokedex pokemon in order of ID by default
● Allow Search queries to search for pokemon based on name, ie 'char' should result in charmander, charmeleon, and charizard.
● Add show option for each pokemon which will present detailed information on pokemon such as Name, ID, Capture rate as a percentage, Types, and what shape the pokemon has(ex. quadruped for venusaur)
